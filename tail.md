Grading Scale
-------------

The following standard grading scale is used to map percentages to letter grades:

Letter Grade   Percentage
------------   ----------
A              93-100%
A-             90-93%
B+             87-90%
B              83-87%
B-             80-83%
C+             77-80%
C              73-77%
C-             70-73%
D+             67-70%
D              63-67%
D-             60-63%
F              0-60%
------------   --------

Late Assignments
----------------

Late assignments will lose 10% for each day they are late rounded up, so an assignment submitted even one second late may be deducted 10%. In certain circumstances, extremely late work may be submitted for up to half credit.

Anderson University Educational Commitment
------------------------------------------

veritas - fidelitas - utilitas

> The mission of Anderson University is to educate for a life of faith and service in the church and society. Across the curriculum students can expect faculty to guide learning experiences toward the development of excellence, integrity, servant leadership, responsibility, and generosity.
>
> As a student of the university you are expected to fully engage in vigorous intellectual and experiential activity where head, heart, and hands are equally engaged and a commitment to Christ is honored.

Academic Honesty
----------------

As an institution of higher education committed to academic and Christian discovery, Anderson University expects faculty and students alike to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity. "Anderson University seeks to support and promote qualities of academic honesty and personal integrity and regards cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty as serious offenses against the University community" (Faculty Handbook 4.23 Policy on Academic Integrity). See the [Student Handbook](https://anderson.edu/student-life/handbook/) for examples of plagiarism.

Generative AI
-------------

In the absence of a clear statement from the faculty instructor for this course giving students permission to use generative AI tools, the use of generative AI on any assignment, quiz, exam, paper, or project shall be treated in the same way as assistance from another person. Unless given clear instruction to the contrary, the use of generative AI tools to complete in any substantial way the work for a course is a violation of the Anderson University Academic Integrity Policy. Students must ask their instructor for clarification if a generative AI source is permitted for the completion of work in a particular course. Students must disclose any assistance with generative AI tools by appropriate citation.

Instructors will provide clear guidance regulating the use of generative AI tools in their course and these guidelines must be stated in the Syllabus at the beginning of the course. In this course, generative AI tools should not be used, except in the following situations:

- [Intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion) is widely used in industry and use of these tools is encouraged when they improve learning and efficiency.
- [Generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) is widely used in industry and use of these tools is encouraged when they improve learning and efficiency.
- Generative AI tools are already generating a high percentage of professional software, and it is expected that [the overwhelming majority of code will be written by AI in the future](https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/github-copilot). In a professional setting, all code committed by a developer is that developer's responsibility and reflects on them personally. The same standard is used in this class. Submitted work is a student's responsibility regardless of what percentage of the work was the output of an AI model. If you do not have complete understanding of implentation and correctness of code you submit, you should not submit it. If you are unable to correctly explain code you submit, this will be treated as academic dishonesty.

Academic Support Statements

### Accessibility and Accommodations

Important: If you have any special accessibility needs (i.e. use of screen reading software, captioning, etc.), please notify your professor and the Director of Student Accessibility Services (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223) as soon as possible.

If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are encouraged to contact the Director of Student Accessibility Services (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223). To receive reasonable accommodations, you must contact Student Accessibility Services, provide documentation, and request accommodations. You should also notify your course instructor during the first week of classes.

### Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence

The [Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence (KACE)](https://anderson.edu/kissinger/services/), located on the ground floor of the Nicholson Library, provides excellent resources in all areas of study regardless of academic ability. Many students can benefit from academic support and/or sharpen their skills through studying with others. In addition, excellent students often maintain their skills by working as peer tutors. The services are available for all enrolled students at no charge. For information, call 765-641-4225.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is fundamental to the teaching/learning process and any absence from a class results in a loss of learning for the student and learning community. It is the student's obligation to personally notify the course instructor about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting hours per week. Where a student misses more than the number of classes stated above, or additional absences as may be allotted by the course instructor, the instructor has the discretion to determine whether missed work may be completed, how much work will be evaluated, and consequences of excessive absences.
Pathways Program
----------------

Anderson University has a robust referral system that was created to connect students with the campus resources that will be most beneficial to them. Students may be referred by faculty for any student success issue. Students will be contacted by an appropriate staff or faculty member to provide support and care.
