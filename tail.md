Grading Scale
-------------

The following standard grading scale is used to map percentages to letter grades:

--- --------
A   93-100%
A-  90-93%
B+  87-90%
B   83-87%
B-  80-83%
C+  77-80%
C   73-77%
C-  70-73%
D+  67-70%
D   63-67%
D-  60-63%
F   0-60%
--- --------

Late Assignments
----------------

Late assignments will lose 10% for each day they are late rounded up, so an assignment submitted even one second late may be deducted 10%. In certain circumstances, extremely late work may be submitted for up to half credit.

Anderson University Educational Commitment
------------------------------------------

veritas - fidelitas - utilitas

> The mission of Anderson University is to educate for a life of faith and service in the church and society. Across the curriculum students can expect faculty to guide learning experiences toward the development of excellence, integrity, servant leadership, responsibility, and generosity. As a student of the university you are expected to fully engage in vigorous intellectual and experiential activity where head, heart, and hands are equally engaged and a commitment to Christ is honored.

COVID-19
--------

As a member of the AU community, we acknowledge our covenant to protect and care for each other by embracing the following measures in this class:  wearing a facial covering, maintaining 6â€™ physical distance from others, and practicing good respiratory and hand hygiene.

Due to the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and factors that are out of control of the instructor, students should be prepared for a (possibly abrupt) pivot in instruction mode. In that situation, learning objectives for the course will remain the same; however the instructor reserves the right to modify due dates as well as the number and frequency of assignments, quizzes, and exams. Any such changes will be communicated via AU email and Canvas.

During this coronavirus pandemic, the AU faculty and staff are making every effort to provide the best possible environment for face-to-face (F2F) instruction, as well as the best online environment, if we are forced to transition online.  We encourage you to follow the community covenant, both on campus and off campus, in your educational environments as well as in your social environments.  These guidelines are intended to maximize the amount of F2F instruction, by reducing the transmission rate of the coronavirus on campus and in the surrounding community.  As such, all computer science department classes taught in face-to-face format will require properly worn facial coverings, 6' physical distancing, and good respiratory and hand hygiene. Accommodations will be made for cases approved by the University for those students who cannot wear a facial covering for health reasons.

The computer science department faculty will facilitate learning in this pandemic environment through the use of tools such as email, Canvas (learning management system), Kaltura (recording F2F lectures and labs), and/or other educational tools. These tools allow for flexible learning, in the cases where students are unable to attend class in person, either through illness, quarantine, the need to care for family members, or other situations.  

Traditional F2F computer science lab activities have included close collaboration between professor and student, and we will need to balance those learning opportunities with the need for physical distancing.  There are several options for close collaboration to occur virtually, using technology such as screen sharing and projecting code onto larger screens.  The CS department faculty will utilize these options to facilitate physically distanced close collaboration in our classroom activities.

It is imperative that we work together to slow the spread, through the community care covenant.  It is very important that we communicate clearly with each other, extending grace towards each other, and solving problems together. Please contact your professor and/or the chair of the Computer Science department, Dr. Jennifer Coy, with any concerns, and keep us up to date regarding any changes in your class attendance.

Academic Honesty
----------------

As an institution of higher education committed to academic and Christian discovery, Anderson University expects faculty and students alike to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity. "Anderson University seeks to support and promote qualities of academic honesty and personal integrity and regards cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty as serious offenses against the University community" (Faculty Handbook 4.23 Policy on Academic Integrity). See the student handbook for examples of plagiarism.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

Important: If you have any special accessibility needs (i.e. use of screen reading software, captioning, etc.), please notify your professor and the Director of Disability Services for Students (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223) as soon as possible.

If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are encouraged to contact the Director of Disability Services for Students (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223). To receive reasonable accommodations, you must contact Disability Services for Students, provide documentation, and request accommodations. You should also notify your course instructor during the first week of classes.

### Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence

The Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence (KACE), located on the ground floor of the Nicholson Library, provides excellent resources in all areas of study regardless of academic ability. Many students can benefit from academic support and/or sharpen their skills through studying with others. In addition, excellent students often maintain their skills by working as peer tutors. The services are available for all enrolled students at no charge. For information, call 765-641-4225.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is fundamental to the teaching/learning process and any absence from a class results in a loss of learning for the student and learning community. It is the student's obligation to personally notify the course instructor about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting hours per week. Where a student misses more than the number of classes stated above, or additional absences as may be allotted by the course instructor, the instructor has the discretion to determine whether missed work may be completed, how much work will be evaluated, and consequences of excessive absences.
