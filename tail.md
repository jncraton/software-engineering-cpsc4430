COVID-19

AU is operating as a fully open campus at this point, but we also acknowledge that in a pandemic we
cannot predict conditions that may arise. For the most up-to-date information regarding mask requirements

Academic Honesty

As an institution of higher education committed to academic and Christian discovery, Anderson University expects faculty and students alike to maintain the highest standards of academic and personal integrity.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

Important: If you have any special accessibility needs (i.e. use of screen reading software, captioning, etc.), please notify your professor and the Director of Disability Services for Students (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223) as soon as possible.

If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are encouraged to contact the Director of Disability Services for Students (Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence, Nicholson Library; 765-641-4223). To receive reasonable accommodations, you must contact Disability Services for Students, provide documentation, and request accommodations. You should also notify your course instructor during the first week of classes.

### Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence

The Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence (KACE), located on the ground floor of the Nicholson Library, provides excellent resources in all areas of study regardless of academic ability. Many students can benefit from academic support and/or sharpen their skills through studying with others. In addition, excellent students often maintain their skills by working as peer tutors. The services are available for all enrolled students at no charge. For information, call 765-641-4225.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is fundamental to the teaching/learning process and any absence from a class results in a loss of learning for the student and learning community. It is the student's obligation to personally notify the course instructor about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting hours per week. Where a student misses more than the number of classes stated above, or additional absences as may be allotted by the course instructor, the instructor has the discretion to determine whether missed work may be completed, how much work will be evaluated, and consequences of excessive absences.
