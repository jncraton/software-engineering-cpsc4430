Final Project Discussion
========================

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
===================================

---

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Example
-------

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def meow():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def bark():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

```python
def make_sound(animal):
  if animal.bark:
    animal.bark()

  if animal.meow:
    animal.meow()
```

---

This violates LSP as Cat and Dog are not interchangable with their base class.

---

This would satisfy LSP:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

A violation of LSP is a violation of OCP.

---

```python
class Rectange():
  ...
  setWidth(self, w):
    self.width = w
  setHeight(self, h):
    self.height = h
  getArea(self):
    return self.width * self.height
```

---

```python
class Square(Rectangle):
  ...
  setWidth(self, w):
    self.width = w
  setHeight(self, h):
    self.height = h
```

---

```python
square = Square()
square.setWidth(5)
square.setHeight(10)
# Is square really a square?
```

---

```python
class Square(Rectangle):
  ...
  setWidth(self, w):
    self.width = w
    self.height = w
  setHeight(self, h):
    self.height = h
    self.width = h
```

---

```python
square = Square()
square.setWidth(5)
square.setHeight(10)
# Width and height are both 10 now
```

---

What about this test for rectangle?

```python
rect = Rectangle()
rect.setWidth(5)
rect.setHeight(10)
assert(rect.getArea() == 50)
```

---

Can we replace Rectangle with Square?

```python
rect = Square()
rect.setWidth(5)
rect.setHeight(10)
assert(rect.getArea() == 50)
```

---

A model viewed in isolation cannot be validated

---

The IS-A relationship depends on expected external behaviors

---

Design by Contract
------------------

Specifies expected behaviors that developers can rely on

Unit Testing
------------

Validates that behavioral expectations are met

Duck Typing
===========

---

```python
class Duck:
  def quack(self):
    print('quack')

class House:
  def quack(self):
    print('quack')
```

---

Python container emulation

```python
class Example:
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return i

example = Example()
print(example[4])
print(example[5])
```

---

Javascript Iterable

```javascript
let range = {
  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
  }
}

for (i of range) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP)
====================================

---

"D" in SOLID

---

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

---

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

---

> ...all well-structured object-oriented architectures have clearly defined layers, with each layer providing some coherent set of services though a well-defined and controlled interface.

---

![Naive Layering Scheme](figures/11-1.png)

Problems
--------

- Depending on lower layers can cause higher layers to break
- Higher layers may be less reusable

---

![Inverted Layers](figures/11-2.png)

---

Lower-level modules implement interfaces that are owned by higher-level modules

---

Depend on abstractions
----------------------

- No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
- No class should derive from a concrete class
- No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes

---

More like guidelines than actual rules

---

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
=====================================

---

"I" in SOLID

---

Some classes have complex interfaces

---

Many clients use only a group of class methods

---

These clients should know about abstract base classes representing cohesive interfaces

---

ISP: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.


Prototypical Inheritance
========================

---

```javascript
let animal = {
  eats: true
}
let bird = {
  flies: true
}

bird.__proto__ = animal
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
Array.prototype.first = function () { return this[0] }
a.first()
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
a.push(3)
console.log(a)
Array.prototype.push = function () { }
a.push(4)
console.log(a)
```
