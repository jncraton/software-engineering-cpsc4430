MVC Example

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
===========================

---

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

---

'O' in SOLID

---

Open for extension
------------------

Behavior of a module can be exteded as requirements change. We can change what a module does.

Closed for modification
-----------------------

Extending behavior does not result in chages to the source or binary code of the module

---

How is this possible?

---

Abstraction
-----------

Abstract base classes

---

Software is changed by adding code rather than changing existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
===================================

---

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Example
-------

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def meow():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def bark():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

This violates LSP as Cat and Dog are not interchangable with their base class.

```python
def make_sound(animal):
  if animal.bark:
    animal.bark()

  if animal.meow:
    animal.meow()
```

---

This would satisfy LSP:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

A violation of LSP is a violation of OCP.
