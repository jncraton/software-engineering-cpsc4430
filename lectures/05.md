Agile Principles
================

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

---

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

---

Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

---

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

---

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Git Example
===========

Getting Started
---------------

- `git init` is used to to create a repository
- Create a regular repositories in directory `a`
- Create a bare repo (`git init --bare`) in `origin`

Initial Commit
--------------

- Add a file with some code to the repo in `a`
    1. Create a new file and give it some content
    2. Use `git add {filename}` to add the content from the working tree to the index
    3. Use `git commit {filename} -m "{message"}` to create a new commit recording these changes

Adding a Remote
---------------

- Add the origin repository as a remote
- `git remote add origin ../origin`
- Use `git remote` to list remotes

Pushing
-------

- Pushing allows us to update remotes refs from our local refs
- `git push` performs this task
- We first need to set the upstream branch using `git push --set-origin origin main`

Cloning
-------

- Repositories can be copied using clone
- Use a command such as `git clone {original} {new}` to clone a repository
- Create a cloned repository `b` using `git clone origin b`

Update B
--------

- Add a new change from `b`
- Push it to origin
- Switch back to `a` and pull your change

Merge Conflicts
---------------

- Create a change in `a` and push it
- Create a change in `b` without pulling first and push it
- Use `git pull` to initiate merging the changes

Resolving Conflicts
-------------------

- Simple merges will be resolved automatically
- Conflicting files can be shown using `git status`
- Conflicting files will show both changes and can be manually edited to resolve the conflict
- Use `git add` to mark as fixed and `git commit` to create a merge commit

Exploring History
-----------------

- `git log` shows history
- `--oneline` removes some info
- `--graph` shows a basic graphical representation on the left


Extreme Programming
===================

---

Extreme programming is a set of software engineering practices that focuses on rapid iteration and responding to change to deliver quality software efficiently.

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interaction between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

Common Template
---------------

As a {role}, I can {capability} so that {receive benefit}

Size
----

- User stories should be as small as possible
- They provide a shared language for communication between customers and developers
- They should have meaning for both parties

Personas
--------

- It is common to create and discuss several personas who will be interacting with the system
- Different classes of users (admins, users, moderators, etc) will have different needs

Examples
--------

- As a user, I can create posts so that I can share with others.
- As a moderator, I can delete posts so that I can remove offensive content.
- As an administrator, I can block users so that their content is hidden from the platform.

Group activity
--------------

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create user stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.
