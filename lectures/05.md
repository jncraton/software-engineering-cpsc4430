Short Cycles
============

---

An XP project delivers work every two weeks.

---

## Iteration Plan

- Represents two weeks of work
- Not always production ready
- Customer selects stories based on budget
- Stories may not change once iteration has started

## Release Plan

- Represents ~3 months of work or ~6 iterations
- Can be released to production
- Customer sets priorities
- Releases can be adjusted at any time

Acceptance tests
================

---

Capture details from user stories programmatically

---

Can be executed to verify that software meets customer needs

---

Tests are run automatically when code is changed

---

Once a test has passed, it is never allowed to fail without being immediately fixed


Pair Programming
================

---

All production code is written in pairs

---

One person uses the keyboard at a time while the other looks for bugs and suggests improvements

---

Pairs rotate through the team each day to encourage knowledge sharing

Test Driven Development (TDD)
=============================

---

All production code is written to make tests pass

---

We write failing tests for functionality that does not exist, and then implement the functionality

---

Time between tests and production code is very short

---

This practice ensures that code is testable

Collective Ownership
====================

---

No individual developer owns any part of the application

Continuous Integration
======================

---

Non-blocking source control

---

Regular check ins

---

Build and test before completing check in

---

Testing is end to end

---
