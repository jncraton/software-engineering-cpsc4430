Lab Feedback
============

Git
---

- Do not approve PRs that are not in good shape
- [Imperative mood](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?h=v2.36.1#n181) in commit messages
- Clean history (use rebase and/or squash and merge)
- Linking issues to PRs

HTML
----

- Accessibility (enter does not submit search)
- Table should include multiple columns rather than "-" separated text
    - See [Semantic HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

UX
-----


- Unlabelled data should not appear and disappear
- [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) - "If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature."

New Issues
----------

- Table should use labelled headings and colums for various fields
- Search as you type, remove search button
- HTML has a built-in toggle (checkbox) and it should be used in place of the "Filter by course mode" button

New Issues
----------

- Column headings for class number and size should sort the table rather than using separate buttons
- Search should not override other filters (filters, sort, and search should all work correctly together)

New Issues
----------

- Table should be appropriately formatted
    - Left align text
    - Right align numbers
    - Align titles with data
