---

Collective Ownership
--------------------

HTML
----

- Accessibility (enter does not submit search)
- Table should include multiple columns rather than "-" separated text
    - See [Semantic HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

UX
-----


- [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) - "If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature."
- If we are sorting by something, it should be visible

New Issues
