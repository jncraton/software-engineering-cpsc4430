Extreme Programming
===================

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interaction between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

---

## Group activity

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create user stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.

Short Cycles
============

---

An XP project delivers work every two weeks.

---

## Iteration Plan

- Represents two weeks of work
- Not always production ready
- Customer selects stories based on budget
- Stories may not change once iteration has started

## Release Plan

- Represents ~3 months of work or ~6 iterations
- Can be released to production
- Customer sets priorities
- Releases can be adjusted at any time

Acceptance tests
================

---

Capture details from user stories programmatically

---

Can be executed to verify that software meets customer needs

---

Tests are run automatically when code is changed

---

Once a test has passed, it is never allowed to fail without being immediately fixed
