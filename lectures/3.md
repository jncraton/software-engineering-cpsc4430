Extreme Programming
===================

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interact between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

---

## Group activity

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create users stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.

Short Cycles
============

---

An XP project delivers work every two weeks.

---

## Iteration Plan

- Represents two weeks of work
- Not always production ready
- Customer selects stories based on budget
- Stories may not change once iteration has started

## Release Plan

- Represents ~3 months of work or ~6 iterations
- Can be released to production
- Customer sets priorities
- Releases can be adjusted at any time

Acceptance tests
================

---

Capture details from user stories programmatically

---

Can be executed to verify that software meets customer needs

---

Tests are run automatically when code is changed

---

Once a test has passed, it is never allowed to fail without being immediately fixed

Pair Programming
================

---

All production code is written in pairs

---

One person uses the keyboard at a time while the other looks for bugs and suggests improvements

---

Pairs rotate through the team each day to encourage knowledge sharing

Test Driven Development (TDD)
=============================

---

All production code is written to make tests pass

---

We write failing tests for functionality that does not exist, and then implement the functionality

---

Time between tests and production code is very short

---

This practice ensures that code is testable

Collective Ownership
====================

---

No individual developer owns any part of the application

Continuous Integration
======================

---

Non-blocking source control

---

Regular check ins

---

Build and test before completing check in

---

Testing is end to end

Sustainable Pace
================

---

A team is not allowed to work overtime

---

Except in the week before a release

Open Workspaces
===============

---

Teams sit together in a shared space

---

Simple Design
=============

---

Design the best system to meet the needs of the current iteration

---

Redesign the system as needed

---

Consider the simplest thing that could possibly work

---

You aren't going to need it

---

Once and only once

Refactoring
===========

---

Code degrades as features are added

---

Degradation is reversed through refactoring

---

Refactoring is a series of tiny transformations that improve the structure of the system without impacting its behavior

---

Refactoring is a continuous process

Metaphor
========

---

Create a set of ideas and terms to use to describe high-level functionality.
