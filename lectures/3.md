Extreme Programming
===================

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interaction between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

---

## Group activity

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create user stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.
