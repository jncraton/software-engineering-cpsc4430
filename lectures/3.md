Extreme Programming
===================

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interact between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

## Group activity

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create users stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local hardware store.

Short Cycles
============

---

An XP project delivers work every two weeks.

---

## Iteration Plan

- Represents two weeks of work
- Not always production ready
- Customer selects stories based on budget
- Stories may not change once iteration has started

## Release Plan

- Represents ~3 months of work or ~6 iterations
- Can be released to production
- Customer sets priorities
- Releases can be adjusted at any time

Acceptance tests
================

---

Capture details from user stories programmatically

---

Can be executed to verify that software meets customer needs

---

Tests are run automatically when code is changed

---

Once a test has passed, it is never allowed to fail without being immediately fixed

Pair Programming
================

---

All production code is written in pairs

---

One person uses the keyboard at a time while the other looks for bugs and suggests improvements

---

Pairs rotate through the team each day to encourage knowledge sharing
