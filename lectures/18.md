Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
=====================================

---

"I" in SOLID

---

Some classes have complex interfaces

---

Many clients use only a group of class methods

---

These clients should know about abstract base classes representing cohesive interfaces

---

ISP: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

---

Create multiple abstact classes and use multiple inheritance

---

```python
class Animal:
  def run(self)
  def fly(self)
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Animal):
  # May need to change if flight behavior changes
```

---

```python
class Flyer:
  def fly(self)

class Runner:
  def run(self)

class Eater:
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Runner, Eater):
  # Never cares about flight behavior
```

Prototypical Inheritance
========================

---

```javascript
let animal = {
  eats: true
}
let bird = {
  flies: true
}

bird.__proto__ = animal
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
Array.prototype.first = function () { return this[0] }
a.first()
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
a.push(3)
console.log(a)
Array.prototype.push = function () { }
a.push(4)
console.log(a)
```
