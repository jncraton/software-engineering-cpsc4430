Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
=====================================

---

"I" in SOLID

---

Some classes have complex interfaces

---

Many clients use only a group of class methods

---

These clients should know about abstract base classes representing cohesive interfaces

---

ISP: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

---

Create multiple abstract classes and use multiple inheritance

---

```python
class Animal:
  def run(self)
  def fly(self)
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Animal):
  # May need to change if flight behavior changes
```

---

```python
class Flyer:
  def fly(self)

class Runner:
  def run(self)

class Eater:
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Runner, Eater):
  # Never cares about flight behavior
```

When adding features to a class, we may instead opt to add a new interface.

Traits
======

Rust
----

> Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance

---

> Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine 

Rust classes
------------

Rust has no classes

Composition vs Inheritance
--------------------------

Rust favors composition over inheritance

Rust Traits
-----------

> A trait is a language feature that tells the Rust compiler about functionality a type must provide.

Prototypical Inheritance
========================

---

```javascript
let animal = {
  eats: true
}
let bird = {
  flies: true
}

bird.__proto__ = animal
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
Array.prototype.first = function () { return this[0] }
a.first()
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
a.push(3)
console.log(a)
Array.prototype.push = function () { }
a.push(4)
console.log(a)
```
