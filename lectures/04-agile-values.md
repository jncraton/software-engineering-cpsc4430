Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
================================================

---

Software cannot be ordered like a commodity

---

Successful projects involve customer feedback on a regular basis

---

The best contracts are those that govern the way the development team and customer will work together

---

The customer knew when a block of functionality satisfied their needs because they watched it evolve from week to week

---

The key to success is intense collaboration with the customer

Responding to change over following a plan
==========================================

---

When we build plans, we need to make sure our plans are flexible

---

The course of a software project cannot be planned very far in the future

---

Plans should have decreasing resolution
