Project Updates
===============

Extreme Programming
===================

Pair Programming
================

---

All production code is written in pairs

---

One person uses the keyboard at a time while the other looks for bugs and suggests improvements

---

Pairs rotate through the team each day to encourage knowledge sharing

Test Driven Development (TDD)
=============================

---

All production code is written to make tests pass

---

We write failing tests for functionality that does not exist, and then implement the functionality

---

Time between tests and production code is very short

---

This practice ensures that code is testable

Collective Ownership
====================

---

No individual developer owns any part of the application

Continuous Integration
======================

---

Non-blocking source control

---

Regular check ins

---

Build and test before completing check in

---

Testing is end to end

Sustainable Pace
================

---

A team is not allowed to work overtime

---

Except in the week before a release
