Extreme Programming
===================

Open Workspaces
===============

---

Teams sit together in a shared space

Simple Design
=============

---

Design the best system to meet the needs of the current iteration

---

Redesign the system as needed

---

Consider the simplest thing that could possibly work

---

You aren't going to need it

---

Once and only once

Refactoring
===========

---

Code degrades as features are added

---

Degradation is reversed through refactoring

---

Refactoring is a series of tiny transformations that improve the structure of the system without impacting its behavior

---

Refactoring is a continuous process

Metaphor
========

---

Create a set of ideas and terms to use to describe high-level functionality.

Chapter 3 - Planning
====================

Initial Exploration
===================

---

Relative time estimates

---

Story size

---

Developers should reestimate when a story is split or merged

---

Velocity (time per point)

---

Spiking to determine initial velocity

Release Planning
================

---

Customers can see the approximate time to complete stories given a velocity

---

Decisions about what stories to complete are driven by the customer

---

Customers can't select more stories than fit based on current velocity

---

Release plan can be updated as velocity is better understood

Iteration Planning
==================

---

Customers select stories

---

Developers select story order based on technical reasons

---

Customer cannot change stories once iteration begins

---

The iteration ends on schedule, even if stories are incomplete

---

Velocity is calculated based on previous iteration

Task Planning
=============

---

Stories are broken in 4-16 hour developer tasks

---

Any developer can select any task to work on

---

Tasks are assigned task points when a developer selects it

---

Developers may not select more task points than they completed in the last iteration

---

Stories may be added or dropped in consultation with customer based on available task point budgets

Halfway Point
=============

---

Half of stories should be complete

---

Customers may pull stories if they cannot be completed

Iterating
=========

---

Customer feedback

---

Adjust stories

---

Measure velocity

---

Adjust priorities
