Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
===================================

---

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Example
-------

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def meow():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def bark():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

This violates LSP as Cat and Dog are not interchangable with their base class.

```python
def make_sound(animal):
  if animal.bark:
    animal.bark()

  if animal.meow:
    animal.meow()
```

---

This would satisfy LSP:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('meow.mp3')


class Dog(Animal):
  def make_sound():
    play('bark.mp3')
```

---

A violation of LSP is a violation of OCP.

Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP)
====================================
