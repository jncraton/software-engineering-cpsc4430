Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP)
====================================

---

"D" in SOLID

---

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

---

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

---

> ...all well-structured object-oriented architectures have clearly defined layers, with each layer providing some coherent set of services though a well-defined and controlled interface.

---

![Naive Layering Scheme](figures/11-1.png)

Problems
--------

- Depending on lower layers can cause higher layers to break
- Higher layers may be less reusable

---

![Inverted Layers](figures/11-2.png)

---

Lower-level modules implement interfaces that are owned by higher-level modules

---

Depend on abstractions
----------------------

- No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
- No class should derive from a concrete class
- No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes

---

More like guidelines than actual rules

QT Example
----------

> Qt (pronounced "cute") is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems

- Explore the high-level class hierarchy of this framework.
- Consider how the principles that we have been discussing are used in practice.


Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
=====================================

---

"I" in SOLID

---

Some classes have complex interfaces

---

Many clients use only a group of class methods

---

These clients should know about abstract base classes representing cohesive interfaces

---

ISP: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

---

Create multiple abstact classes and use multiple inheritance

---

```python
class Animal:
  def run(self)
  def fly(self)
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Animal):
  # May need to change if flight behavior changes
```

---

```python
class Flyer:
  def fly(self)

class Runner:
  def run(self)

class Eater:
  def eat(self)

class Dog(Runner, Eater):
  # Never cares about flight behavior
```

Prototypical Inheritance
========================

---

```javascript
let animal = {
  eats: true
}
let bird = {
  flies: true
}

bird.__proto__ = animal
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
Array.prototype.first = function () { return this[0] }
a.first()
```

---

```javascript
a = [1, 2]
a.push(3)
console.log(a)
Array.prototype.push = function () { }
a.push(4)
console.log(a)
```
