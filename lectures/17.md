Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP)
====================================

---

"D" in SOLID

---

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

---

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

---

> ...all well-structured object-oriented architectures have clearly defined layers, with each layer providing some coherent set of services though a well-defined and controlled interface.

---

![Naive Layering Scheme](figures/11-1.png)

Problems
--------

- Depending on lower layers can cause higher layers to break
- Higher layers may be less reusable

---

![Inverted Layers](figures/11-2.png)

---

Lower-level modules implement interfaces that are owned by higher-level modules

---

Depend on abstractions
----------------------

- No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
- No class should derive from a concrete class
- No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes

---

More like guidelines than actual rules

QT Example
----------

> Qt (pronounced "cute") is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems
