- Maintainability
- Speed
- Cost

Waterfall Model
===============

![Waterfall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Waterfall_model.svg){height=540px}

---

Waterfall may work well for traditional engineering where designs are expensive.

---

Iterating this process is often more effective than using it one time from start to finish.

We can generally do better than waterfall in software engineering, in part because iterations are cheap.

Agile Values
------------

- Individuals and actions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
