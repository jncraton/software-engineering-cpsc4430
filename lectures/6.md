Test Driven Development
=======================

---

Write tests first

---

No code is written except that which is written to make tests pass

Outcomes
--------

- Every function is testable
- Every function has tests
- Functions are conveniently callable

Benefits
--------

- We know when we break something
- We feel more free to make changes
- Architecture is simpler
- Architecture is decoupled

Acceptance Tests
----------------

- Unit tests verify small elements of the systems (function, etc)
- Acceptance tests verify stories and features
