Agile Values
============

Individuals and actions over processes and tools
================================================

---

A group of strong players can fail if they don't work as a team

---

A strong player may well be an average programmer who works well with others

---

Don't assume that you've outgrown a tool until you've tried it

---

Building the team is more important than building the environment

Working software over comprehensive documentation
=================================================

---

Code is not the ideal medium for communicating the rationale and structure of a system

---

Too much documentation is worse than too little

---

Short and salient

---

Make new team members welcome through close training and interaction

---

Code does not lie about what it does

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
================================================

---

Software cannot be ordered like a commodity

---

Successful projects involve customer feedback on a regular basis

---

The best contracts are those that govern the way the development team and customer will work together

---

The key to success is intense collaboration with the customer
