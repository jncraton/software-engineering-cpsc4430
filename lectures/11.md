Refactoring
===========

---

Refactoring is about human attention.

---

Refactoring is the difference between getting something working and getting something working right.

---

Refactoring is changing program structure without changing behavior

Purpose of a Module
-------------------

- Perform its task correctly
- Afford change
- Communicate to readers

---

We can all write correct code

---

Tests and other principles help us create code that can be changed

---

Refactoring helps us to create code that better communicates its purpose readers

Refactoring Example
===================

Agile Design
============

---

The source code is the design

---

UML diagrams or other models may be used to plan or document the design

---

What goes wrong with software?
------------------------------

---

Working code is created

---

Features are added

---

Bugs are fixed

---

Code rots

Design Smells
-------------

---

Rigidity - The system is hard to change because changes cause an avalanche of change

---

Fragility - Changes cause breaks in unexpected ways

---

Immobility - It is hard to break the system into reusable components

---

Viscosity - Doing things right is harder than doing them wrong

---

Needless complexity - Design contains infrastructure that provides no benefit

---

Needless repetition - Design contains repeated structures that could be merged via abstraction

---

Opacity - Design is hard to read and does not express intent

---

- Rigidity - Hard to change
- Fragility - Easy to break
- Immobility - Hard to reuse
- Viscosity - The right way is hard
- Needless complexity
- Needless repetition
- Opacity - Does not express intent

Causes of Rot
-------------

---

Requirements change in ways that were not expected in the initial design

---

Changes need to be implemented quickly

---

Developers may not be aware of original design philosophy

Agile prevents rot
------------------

---

Agile thrives on change

---

Minimal upfront investment

---

Change is simplified and anticipated

---

Design is always appropriate for current needs

What is Agile Design?
---------------------

1. Identify problem using practices
2. Diagnose problem applying design principles
3. Solve problem using design pattern

---

Design always stays clean

---

There should not be a need to stop progress and refactor

---

Source code is the design. If the source code is not clean, the design is not clean

---

Agile design is a process, not an event

---

Principles must be followed continuously

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
=====================================

---

A structure (class) should have only one reason to change

---

The 'S' in SOLID

---

![SRP](figures/srp.png)

---

Structures should be responsible for only one thing

Why?
----

- Decoupling
- Change management
- Prevents fragility and unexpected breakage

Definition of responsibility
----------------------------

Simply a reason to change

---

If an application is not changing in ways that cause different things to change at different times, there is not a need to separate them.

---

Persistence should be separate from business rules
