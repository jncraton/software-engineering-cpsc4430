Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
================================================

---

Software cannot be ordered like a commodity

---

Successful projects involve customer feedback on a regular basis

---

The best contracts are those that govern the way the development team and customer will work together

---

The key to success is intense collaboration with the customer

Responding to change over following a plan
==========================================

---

When we build plans, we need to make sure our plans are flexible

---

The course of a software project cannot be planned very far in the future

---

Plans should have decreasing resolution

Agile Principles
================

---

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software

---

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

---

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale

---

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

---

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

---

Working software is the primary measure of progress.
