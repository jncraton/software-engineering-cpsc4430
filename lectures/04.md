Extreme Programming
===================

---

Extreme programming is a set of software engineering practices that focuses on rapid iteration and responding to change to deliver quality software efficiently.

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interaction between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

Common Template
---------------

As a <role>, I can <capability> so that <receive benefit>

Size
----

- User stories should be as small as possible
- They provide a shared language for communication between customers and developers
- They should have meaning for both parties

Personas
--------

- It is common to create and discuss several personas who will be interacting with the system
- Different classes of users (admins, users, moderators, etc) will have different needs

Examples
--------

- As a user, I can create posts so that I can share with others.
- As a moderator, I can delete posts so that I can remove offensive content.
- As an administrator, I can block users so that their content is hidden from the platform.

Group activity
--------------

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create user stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.

Short Cycles
============

---

An XP project delivers work every two weeks.

---

## Iteration Plan

- Represents two weeks of work
- Not always production ready
- Customer selects stories based on budget
- Stories may not change once iteration has started

## Release Plan

- Represents ~3 months of work or ~6 iterations
- Can be released to production
- Customer sets priorities
- Releases can be adjusted at any time

Acceptance tests
================

---

Capture details from user stories programmatically

---

Can be executed to verify that software meets customer needs

---

Tests are run automatically when code is changed

---

Once a test has passed, it is never allowed to fail without being immediately fixed


Pair Programming
================

---

All production code is written in pairs

---

One person uses the keyboard at a time while the other looks for bugs and suggests improvements

---

Pairs rotate through the team each day to encourage knowledge sharing

Test Driven Development (TDD)
=============================

---

All production code is written to make tests pass

---

We write failing tests for functionality that does not exist, and then implement the functionality

---

Time between tests and production code is very short

---

This practice ensures that code is testable
