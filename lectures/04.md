Responding to change over following a plan
==========================================

---

When we build plans, we need to make sure our plans are flexible

---

The course of a software project cannot be planned very far in the future

---

Plans should have decreasing resolution

Agile Principles
================

---

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software

---

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

---

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale

---

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

---

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

---

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

---

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

---

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

---

Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

---

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

---

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Extreme Programming
===================

---

Extreme programming is a set of software engineering practices that focuses on rapid iteration and responding to change to deliver quality software efficiently.

Customer as team member
=======================

---

Constant interaction between customer and developers

---

Best for the customer to be local

---

Users Stories
=============

---

We must know something about the requirements, but we don't need to know very much.

---

We get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer, but we don't capture that detail

---

Customer writes a few words to remind us of the conversations

---

Developers write a time estimate on the card

Common Template
---------------

As a {role}, I can {capability} so that {receive benefit}

Size
----

- User stories should be as small as possible
- They provide a shared language for communication between customers and developers
- They should have meaning for both parties

Personas
--------

- It is common to create and discuss several personas who will be interacting with the system
- Different classes of users (admins, users, moderators, etc) will have different needs

Examples
--------

- As a user, I can create posts so that I can share with others.
- As a moderator, I can delete posts so that I can remove offensive content.
- As an administrator, I can block users so that their content is hidden from the platform.

Group activity
--------------

- Choose 1 person to be the customer
- Create user stories as if you are a team working to build an inventory management system for a local grocery store.
