Agile Design
============

Design Smells
-------------

---

Rigidity - The system is hard to change because changes cause an avalanche of change

---

Fragility - Changes cause breaks in unexpected ways

---

Immobility - It is hard to break the system into reusable components

---

Viscosity - Doing things right is harder than doing them wrong

---

Needless complexity - Design contains infrastructure that provides no benefit
